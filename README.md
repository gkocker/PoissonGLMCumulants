# PoissonGLM_Cumulants

This repository contains code to compute joint cumulants of the spike trains of nonlinear point process GLMs (nonlinear multivariate Hawkes processes) to one loop order. Details are contained in "Linking structure and activity in nonlinear spiking networks" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03828; in press, PloS CB).

That paper presents the rules in the temporal domain. The code here operates in the Fourier domain in order to avoid a number of time integrals.
