# PoissonGLM_Cumulants

This repository contains code to compute joint cumulants of the spike trains of nonlinear point process GLMs (nonlinear multivariate Hawkes processes) to one loop order. Details are contained in the paper "Linking structure and activity in nonlinear spiking networks" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03828)
